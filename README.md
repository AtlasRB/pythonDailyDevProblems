# Python Daily.Dev Problems
This project is to complete the code problems on https://daily.dev/blog/fun-coding-problems-from-easy-to-hard. The problems will be completed in the JavaScript language. I am also doing these problems in another project using the Python language.

The webpage is built using react. It features a carousel navigational menu to look between the problems. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS.
